DAY 2 – COMMANDS PRACTICE

1. cd (Change Directory)
Used to move between directories in the Linux filesystem.

Examples:
cd /home/user        → Move to absolute path
cd Documents         → Move to a folder inside current directory
cd ..                → Move one directory back
cd ~                 → Move to home directory

DevOps use case:
Used to navigate to application folders, log directories,
or configuration paths on servers.


2. mkdir (Make Directory)
Creates one or more directories.

Examples:
mkdir logs            → Create a directory named logs
mkdir app config      → Create multiple directories
mkdir -p app/logs     → Create parent and child directories together

DevOps use case:
Used to create folders for applications, logs, backups,
and deployment files.


3. touch
Creates empty files or updates file timestamps.

Examples:
touch app.log
touch config.yml

DevOps use case:
Used to create configuration files, log files,
shell scripts, or placeholder files.


4. cp (Copy)
Copies files or directories from one location to another.

Examples:
cp file.txt backup.txt         → Copy file
cp file.txt /backup/           → Copy file to another directory
cp -r app /backup/app          → Copy directory recursively

DevOps use case:
Used to take backups of configuration files,
application code, and important data.


5. mv (Move / Rename)
Moves or renames files and directories.

Examples:
mv old.txt new.txt             → Rename file
mv app.log /logs/              → Move file to another directory
mv app old_app                 → Rename directory

DevOps use case:
Used during deployments, renaming builds,
and organizing application files.


6. rm (Remove)
Deletes files and directories.

Examples:
rm file.txt                    → Delete file
rm -r folder_name              → Delete directory and contents
rm -rf folder_name             → Force delete without confirmation

DevOps warning:
Wrong usage can delete critical system files.
Always double-check before running rm.

DevOps use case:
Used to clean old logs, remove unused files,
or delete failed deployment data.
