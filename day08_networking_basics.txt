DAY 8 – LINUX NETWORKING BASICS

Why networking is important?
In DevOps, applications run on servers that communicate
over networks. Understanding networking is critical for
deployments, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

---

1. What is Networking?
Networking allows computers and servers to communicate
with each other using IP addresses and ports.

---

2. IP Address

An IP address uniquely identifies a system on a network.

Types:
- IPv4 (example: 192.168.1.10)
- IPv6 (newer format)

---

3. Network Interfaces

A network interface connects a system to a network.

Examples:
eth0, ens33, wlan0

---

4. Check IP Address

Commands:
ip addr
ip a

Older command:
ifconfig (deprecated)

Use case:
Verify system IP configuration.

---

5. Check Network Connectivity

ping:
Tests network connectivity.

Example:
ping google.com
ping 8.8.8.8

Use case:
Check if server can reach network or internet.

---

6. Ports and Services

What is a port?
A port is a communication endpoint for services.

Examples:
- 22 → SSH
- 80 → HTTP
- 443 → HTTPS

One IP can host multiple services using ports.

---

7. Check Open Ports

Command:
ss -tuln

Older command:
netstat -tuln

Use case:
Check which services are listening.

---

8. Check Service Port Mapping

Command:
ss -tulpn

Shows:
- Port number
- Service name
- PID

---

9. curl Command

curl is used to test web services.

Example:
curl http://localhost
curl http://127.0.0.1

Use case:
Check if web server is responding.

---

10. wget Command

Used to download files.

Example:
wget http://example.com/file.txt

---

11. Hostname and DNS

Check hostname:
hostname

DNS resolution:
nslookup google.com
dig google.com

---

12. Real DevOps Scenarios

Scenario 1:
Website not accessible.

Check:
- Service running
- Port open
- Firewall
- Network connectivity

Scenario 2:
Server cannot reach internet.

Check:
- IP address
- Gateway
- DNS

---

13. Best Practices

- Know common ports
- Use ss instead of netstat
- Test locally with curl
- Always verify connectivity
