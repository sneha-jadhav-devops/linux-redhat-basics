DAY 4 – FILE PERMISSIONS & OWNERSHIP

Why permissions are important?
In Linux, every file and directory has permissions that control
who can read, write, or execute them.

Incorrect permissions are one of the most common reasons why:
- Applications fail to start
- Deployments break
- Scripts show “Permission denied”
- Security vulnerabilities occur

DevOps engineers must understand permissions to:
- Secure servers and applications
- Ensure services run correctly
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Fix production issues quickly
