DAY 11 – SHELL SCRIPTING (BASH)

Why shell scripting is important?
DevOps engineers automate repetitive tasks using scripts.
Shell scripts reduce manual work, errors, and save time.

Automation is a core DevOps responsibility.

---

1. What is a Shell?
A shell is a command-line interpreter.
It takes user commands and executes them.

Common shells:
- bash (most common)
- sh
- zsh

---

2. What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a file containing Linux commands
executed sequentially.

File extension:
.sh

---

3. Shebang (#!)

The first line of a script.

Example:
#!/bin/bash

It tells the system which interpreter to use.

---

4. Creating and Running a Script

Create file:
touch script.sh

Edit:
nano script.sh

Make executable:
chmod +x script.sh

Run:
./script.sh
or
bash script.sh

---

5. Variables

Syntax:
variable_name=value

Example:
name="DevOps"
echo $name

Rules:
- No spaces around =
- Case-sensitive

---

6. User Input

Read input:
read variable

Example:
read username
echo "Hello $username"

---

7. Arguments to Script

Access arguments:
$1, $2, $3

Example:
./script.sh nginx

$1 → nginx

---

8. Conditional Statements (if)

Syntax:
if [ condition ]; then
  commands
fi

Example:
if [ -f file.txt ]; then
  echo "File exists"
fi

Common conditions:
-f → file exists
-d → directory exists
-e → exists

---

9. Loops

For loop:
for i in 1 2 3
do
  echo $i
done

While loop:
while true
do
  echo "Running..."
  sleep 5
done

---

10. Functions

Syntax:
function_name() {
  commands
}

Example:
check_service() {
  systemctl status nginx
}

---

11. Exit Codes

Every command returns an exit code.

0 → success
Non-zero → failure

Check exit code:
$?

---

12. Real DevOps Automation Examples

Example 1:
Check disk usage and alert.

Example 2:
Check service status and restart if down.

Example 3:
Backup files automatically.

13. Best Practices

- Use comments
- Use meaningful variable names
- Validate inputs
- Handle errors
- Log outputs
