DAY 4 – PERMISSIONS PRACTICE


1. View file permissions using ls -l

Command:
ls -l

What it does:
Displays file permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time.

Example output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user devops 1200 app.conf

Explanation:
- Owner can read and write
- Group can read
- Others can read

DevOps use case:
Used to identify permission issues when applications fail.


2. Change permissions using chmod

Command:
chmod permissions filename

Numeric values:
4 → read
2 → write
1 → execute

Example:
chmod 644 app.conf

Meaning:
Owner → read, write
Group → read
Others → read

DevOps use case:
Securing configuration files and preventing unauthorized edits.


3. Make scripts executable

Problem:
Script shows "Permission denied" when executed.

Check permissions:
ls -l deploy.sh

Fix:
chmod +x deploy.sh

Run script:
./deploy.sh

DevOps use case:
Required to run deployment, backup, and automation scripts.


4. Change file ownership using chown

Command:
chown user filename
chown user:group filename

Example:
chown root:root app.conf

DevOps use case:
Ensuring files are owned by the correct user or service
to allow applications to access required files.


5. Fix permission denied issues

Common error:
Permission denied

Steps to fix:
1. Check permissions using ls -l
2. Check ownership using ls -l
3. Modify permissions using chmod
4. Modify ownership using chown

Example:
ls -l app.conf
chmod 644 app.conf
chown appuser:appgroup app.conf

DevOps use case:
Daily troubleshooting task in production environments.
