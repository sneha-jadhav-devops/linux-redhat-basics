DAY 7 – SYSTEM SERVICES & SYSTEMCTL

Why services are important?
Linux servers run applications in the background as services.
Examples include web servers, databases, and monitoring agents.

DevOps engineers manage services to ensure applications
start, stop, restart, and recover properly.

---

1. What is a Service?
A service (daemon) is a program that runs in the background.

Examples:
- nginx (web server)
- sshd (remote access)
- crond (scheduled tasks)

Service processes usually end with 'd'.

---

2. What is systemd?
systemd is the system and service manager in modern Linux.

It handles:
- Service startup
- Boot process
- Logging
- Dependency management

Command tool:
systemctl

---

3. Checking Service Status

Command:
systemctl status service_name

Example:
systemctl status nginx

Shows:
- Running or stopped
- PID
- Logs
- Errors

---

4. Starting and Stopping Services

Start a service:
systemctl start nginx

Stop a service:
systemctl stop nginx

Restart a service:
systemctl restart nginx

Reload configuration:
systemctl reload nginx

---

5. Enable & Disable Services at Boot

Enable service:
systemctl enable nginx

Disable service:
systemctl disable nginx

Check enable status:
systemctl is-enabled nginx

DevOps use case:
Ensure services start automatically after reboot.

---

6. List Services

List all services:
systemctl list-units --type=service

List active services:
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

---

7. Service Log Analysis

View logs:
journalctl -u nginx

Live logs:
journalctl -u nginx -f

Use case:
Debug service failures.

---

8. Common Service Failures

Service fails to start:
- Configuration error
- Port already in use
- Permission issue

Fix steps:
1. systemctl status service
2. journalctl -u service
3. Fix config
4. Restart service

---

9. Real DevOps Scenarios

Scenario 1:
Web server not accessible after reboot.

Fix:
systemctl enable nginx

Scenario 2:
Service crashes after config change.

Fix:
systemctl restart nginx
Check logs.

Scenario 3:
Service not starting.

Fix:
Check permissions and logs.

---

10. Best Practices

- Always enable critical services
- Check logs before restarting
- Reload configs when possible
- Monitor service health
