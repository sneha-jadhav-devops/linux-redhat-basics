DAY 3 – LOG PRACTICE

Logs are records of system and application activity.
They are used to debug issues and monitor systems.

Common DevOps log tasks:

- View full log:
cat app.log

- View large log safely:
less app.log

- Check recent activity:
tail app.log

- Monitor live logs:
tail -f app.log

- Check starting lines:
head app.log
