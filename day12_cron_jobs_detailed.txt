DAY 12 – CRON JOBS & TASK SCHEDULING

Why cron jobs are important?
Cron allows tasks to run automatically at scheduled times.
DevOps engineers use cron for backups, log cleanup,
health checks, monitoring, and reports.

Automation without scheduling is incomplete.

1. What is Cron?
Cron is a Linux time-based job scheduler.
It runs commands or scripts automatically.

Cron service:

2. crontab

crontab = cron table
Each user has their own crontab.

6. Cron Environment (IMPORTANT)

Cron runs with limited environment.

Common issues:
- PATH not set

---

8. System-wide Cron

System crontab:
 /etc/crontab

Cron directories:
 /etc/cron.hourly
 /etc/cron.daily
 /etc/cron.weekly
 /etc/cron.monthly

Used for system maintenance.

---

10. Common Cron Issues
