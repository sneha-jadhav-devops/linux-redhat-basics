DAY 6 – PACKAGE MANAGEMENT (YUM / DNF)

Why package management is important?
In Linux, software is installed using package managers.
DevOps engineers must install, update, and manage software
on servers in a secure and controlled way.

Manually installing software is risky and not scalable.

1. What is a Package?
A package is a compressed file that contains:
- Application files
- Configuration files
- Dependencies
- Metadata

Examples:
nginx, httpd, git, docker

---

2. What is a Package Manager?
A package manager:
- Installs software
- Resolves dependencies
- Updates packages
- Removes software safely

RHEL-based package managers:
- yum (older)
- dnf (newer, faster)

---

3. YUM vs DNF

yum:
- Older package manager
- Used in CentOS 7 / RHEL 7

dnf:
- Default in RHEL 8+
- Faster and better dependency handling

In most systems, yum is linked to dnf.

4. Package Repositories

What is a repository?
A repository is a remote server that stores packages.

Types:
- BaseOS
- AppStream
- EPEL (Extra Packages)

Repo files location:
/etc/yum.repos.d/

---

5. Searching Packages

Command:
yum search package_name

Example:
yum search nginx

Use case:
Find correct package name before installation.

---

6. Installing Packages

Command:
yum install package_name

Example:
yum install nginx

Flags:
-y → auto yes

Example:
yum install -y git

---

7. Removing Packages

Command:
yum remove package_name

Example:
yum remove nginx

Use case:
Cleanly uninstall software.

---

8. Updating Packages

Update all packages:
yum update

Update specific package:
yum update nginx

DevOps best practice:
Regular updates for security patches.

---

9. Package Information

Command:
yum info package_name

Example:
yum info httpd

Shows:
- Version
- Size
- Repository
- Description

---

10. List Installed Packages

Command:
yum list installed

Check specific package:
yum list installed | grep nginx

---

11. Cleaning Cache

Command:
yum clean all

Use case:
Fix cache-related issues.

---

12. Real DevOps Scenarios

Scenario 1:
Package installation fails due to dependency issue.

Fix:
yum clean all
yum install package

Scenario 2:
Server missing git.

Fix:
yum install git

Scenario 3:
Need specific version.

Fix:
yum list available | grep package

13. Best Practices

- Use official repositories
- Avoid manual rpm installs
- Keep systems updated
- Use -y cautiously
