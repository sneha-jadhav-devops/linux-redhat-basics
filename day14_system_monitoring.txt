DAY 14 – SYSTEM MONITORING & RESOURCE ANALYSIS

Why monitoring is important?
Monitoring ensures system health, availability, and performance.
Without monitoring, issues are discovered only after failures.

DevOps engineers monitor systems to:
- Prevent downtime
- Detect performance issues
- Scale infrastructure
- Maintain SLAs

---

1. What is System Monitoring?
System monitoring is the process of observing
CPU, memory, disk, network, and processes
to ensure optimal performance.

---

2. Key System Resources

CPU     → processing power
Memory  → running applications
Disk    → storage usage
Network → data transfer
Process → running services

---

3. CPU Monitoring Basics

High CPU usage causes:
- Slow applications
- Delays
- Service timeouts

Key terms:
User time
System time
Idle time
Load average

---

4. Load Average Explained

Load average shows:
- Number of processes waiting for CPU

Examples:
1.00 → 1 CPU fully used
2.00 → CPU overloaded (on 1 core)

---

5. Memory Monitoring Basics

Memory issues cause:
- Slowness
- Application crashes
- OOM kills

Types:
Used memory
Free memory
Cached memory
Swap memory

---

6. Disk Monitoring Basics

Disk issues cause:
- Application failures
- Database crashes
- Log write failures

Important metrics:
Disk usage %
Inode usage
Read/write latency

---

7. Process Monitoring

Processes consume CPU and memory.
Runaway processes can crash systems.

---

8. Monitoring in DevOps Lifecycle

Development → capacity planning
Testing → performance testing
Production → live monitoring
Incident → root cause analysis

9. Manual vs Automated Monitoring

Manual:

Automated:
Prometheus
Grafana
CloudWatch
Datadog
Nagios

10. Monitoring Best Practices

- Monitor trends, not just spikes
- Set alerts
- Automate checks
- Document incidents
