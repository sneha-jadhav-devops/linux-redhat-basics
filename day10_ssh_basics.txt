DAY 10 – SSH & SECURE REMOTE ACCESS

Why SSH is important?
SSH (Secure Shell) is used to securely connect to remote servers.
DevOps engineers use SSH daily to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot systems.

---

1. What is SSH?
SSH is a secure protocol that allows encrypted communication
between a client and a server over a network.

Default port:
22

---

2. SSH Architecture

Client:
Your local machine

Server:
Remote Linux machine

Service:
sshd (SSH daemon)

---

3. Installing SSH

Check if SSH is installed:
rpm -qa | grep openssh

Install SSH:
sudo yum install -y openssh-server

Start SSH service:
sudo systemctl start sshd

Enable SSH on boot:
sudo systemctl enable sshd

---

4. Connecting to a Remote Server

Command:
ssh username@server_ip

Example:
ssh devuser@192.168.1.10

---

5. SSH Configuration File

Server config file:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Client config file:
~/.ssh/config

---

6. Password-Based Authentication

Default authentication method.
Not recommended for production.

Risks:
- Brute-force attacks
- Weak passwords

---

7. Key-Based Authentication (RECOMMENDED)

Why keys?
- More secure
- No passwords
- Automation friendly

Generate SSH key:
ssh-keygen

Key files:
~/.ssh/id_rsa (private key)
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public key)

---

8. Copy Public Key to Server

Command:
ssh-copy-id username@server_ip

Manual method:
Add public key to:
~/.ssh/authorized_keys

---

9. Disable Password Authentication (Security)

Edit:
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Set:
PasswordAuthentication no

Restart SSH:
systemctl restart sshd

---

10. Change Default SSH Port (Optional)

Edit:
Port 2222

Restart SSH.

Note:
Update firewall rules accordingly.

---

11. Real DevOps Scenarios

Scenario 1:
Cannot SSH into server.

Check:
- SSH service running
- Firewall port allowed
- Correct IP and user

Scenario 2:
Permission denied (publickey).

Fix:
- Check authorized_keys
- Check file permissions

---

12. Best Practices

- Use SSH keys
- Disable root login
- Change default port
- Restrict users
- Monitor SSH logs
