DAY 5 – LINUX USERS, GROUPS & SUDO

Why users and groups are important?
Linux is a multi-user operating system.
Different users and services must have controlled access
to files, processes, and system resources.

Running everything as root is dangerous.
DevOps engineers follow the principle of least privilege.

1. Types of Users in Linux

Root user:
- Username: root
- User ID (UID): 0
- Full system access

Normal users:
- Created for human users
- Limited permissions

System users:
- Used by services and applications
- Examples: nginx, apache, mysql

---

2. User Information Files

/etc/passwd
Stores user account information

/etc/shadow
Stores encrypted passwords (root access only)

/etc/group
Stores group information

---

3. Viewing User Information

Commands:
whoami
id
groups

Use case:
Used to identify current user and group membership.

---

4. Creating Users

Command:
useradd username
passwd username

Example:
useradd devuser
passwd devuser

DevOps use case:
Creating separate users for applications and services.

---

5. Deleting Users

Command:
userdel username

Example:
userdel devuser

---

6. Groups in Linux

Why groups are used?
Groups simplify permission management.

Commands:
groupadd groupname
groupdel groupname
usermod -aG group user

Example:
groupadd devops
usermod -aG devops devuser

---

7. sudo (Super User Do)

What is sudo?
Allows a normal user to execute commands as root.

Command:
sudo command

Example:
sudo yum update

Why sudo is important?
- Avoids logging in as root
- Improves security
- Logs commands

---

8. su vs sudo

su:
Switches to another user (usually root)

sudo:
Runs single command as root

DevOps best practice:
Use sudo instead of su.

---

9. REAL DEVOPS SCENARIOS

Scenario 1:
Application needs permission to read a directory.

Fix:
- Create user
- Assign group
- Set permissions

Scenario 2:
User needs admin access without root login.

Fix:
- Add user to sudoers group

---

10. Best Practices

- Never run apps as root
- Use sudo for admin tasks
- Assign least privileges
- Use groups for access control
